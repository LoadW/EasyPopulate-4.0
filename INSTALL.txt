PRIOR TO INSTALLATION:

I would highly recommend that you install Dr. Bytes "Backup MYSQL Plugin" before installing and using EasyPopulate 4.0 Beta (EP4).
You can download it here:
http://www.zen-cart.com/index.php?main_page=product_contrib_info&products_id=81

Also note that EasyPopulate 4.0 Beta will install and run independently of all other versions of easypopulate. 

INSTALLATION:

1. Change the name of the "admin" directory to match your Zencart installation. 

2. Upload all files in the "admin" directory to your site maintaining directory structure.
   No core files are changed.

	a) If you are using zencart 1.3.8/1.3.9, you need to also upload the additional files in the "zencart 1.3 extra files" folder. 

	b)  If you are using zencart 1.5, you need to also upload the additional files in the "zencart 1.5 extra files" folder. 

3. Login to your store's admin. Under Tools you will see a new entry "Easy Populate 4". 
   (If you do not see this entry, you did not upload your files correctly.)

4. Click on Tools -> Easy Populate 4. You will have 1 (possibly 2) warnings at the top of the page:

   Warning Easy Populate "Uploads Folder" missing!
   Your uploads folder is missing. Your configuration indicates that your uploads folder is named EASYPOPULATE_4_CONFIG_TEMP_DIR/, and is located in .../public_html/.
   Warning Easy Populate Configuration Missing. Please install your configuration by clicking here

   Click the "here" link to install EP4's configuration files.

5. Now go to Configuration -> Easy Populate 4 and edit the Uploads Directory. The default directory is "temp/"
   This assumes you have a directory "temp" in the root of your website. I highly recommend that you
   move your temp directory into your admin, or change the name to something that is obscure for security reasons.

6. If you now click on Tools -> Easy Populate 4, you shouldn't see any warning messages. Note that your temp/
   directory will need correct permissions. EP4 will give you a warning if it cannot write to the temp/ directory
   that you set. Common permissions are "777" or "755". Contact your hosting provider if you are having problems
   setting permissions to writable.

UN-INSTALLATION:

To un-install EP4, go to Tools -> Easy Populate 4 and click the Un-Install EP4 link on the right-hand side of your screen.
This will remove the Configuration keys for EP4. You will then need to delete EP4's files from your server. 


POST INSTALLATION NOTES:

My EP4 will display the current version and Beta date. This will help you keep track of your version.

On the right-hand side of your screen you will see some:
	- An un-install link that will remove EP4's configuration keys.
	- Your currently set Temporary Directory
	- Supported Mod
	- Installed Languages

Supported Mods: These are where the some change to the core files has been made. Most notably additional fields the the products table.
Not that Product Unit of Measure (UOM) and Product UPC Code are two of my own custom mods that I have as yet not release. Perhaps I'll
put those up on github in the near future, but they involve heavy edits to core files. 




I will continue to update my github with updates. Once EP4 has passed "beta" I will submit it 
to the Zencart team for consideration. Your fee
